What is CSS? 
********************************************
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

CSS selector
******************************************

-The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
-The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
-Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}

-p is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: <p>).
-color is a property, and red is the property value
-text-align is a property, and center is the property value
